Script Run order:
1) Yokogawa
2) (possibly) REST_API
3) newMain

Implemented scripts:
- newMain.py
	- ingests Test Sequences
	- calls/controls relays
	- commands/controls GridSim/MX45
- gridsim.py
	- script to quickly command/control the MX45 without need for creating a new test sequence
- yokogawa.py
	- script to log data from the Yokogawa WT1600 DAQ
- REST_API.py
	- script to query and log data from the Edge Systems
- relayScript.py
	- script to turn relays on/off, gets called by newMain.py

TBD Work:
- NHR/E-Load 
- PV-sims
- Exit conditions for REST_API/Edge Systems
- Clean up newMain.py
- Scalability
- Modularity
- UI(?) for Test Sequence/Configuration generation
